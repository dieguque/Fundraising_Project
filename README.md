# Fundraising at the NYC subways stations (MTA)
Diego Duque Marquez

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to find the best days and weeks in November, December and January to do a fundraising at the NTC suways satitions using public data. The [MTA](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) website was used to get the data through scraping. I used Python for the whole scraping process and other packages for the modeling.

## Design
A hypothetical situation was created where a the American Cancer Society asked us to recomend the best day to do a fundraising at top 5 the NY metro statios because they have a 5 weeks budget.

## Data
The [MTA data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) scraped includes 14 weeks of turnstiles data from November 2020, December 2020, and January 2021. 
This data was scraped using a Python function. In total 2942639 rows were scraped.
